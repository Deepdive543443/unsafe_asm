    In the previous two instructions, we have the result store in register 
    r0. Then, by calling "bx lr" here, we return the value of r0 by function.

    What bx(branch and exchange) does is copy the copy the content of LR 
    register into PC register, which contain the return address. Hopefully 
    the later session will cover more details about this  */
